- 👋 Hi, I’m @enderfree
- 👀 I’m interested in so much things I am not sure in what to specialise!
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my AEC that will certify me as a Computer Program-Analyst!
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to colaborate on something as I plan on dedicating the rest of my session to school.
- 📫 How to reach me: I myself am not sure!

I will totally change this file when I will feel a bit more ready to introduce myself, right now I am just getting comfortable on github!
