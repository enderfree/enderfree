Hello, 
I'm Samuel. I am currently looking for my next contract or a permanant employment and I look forward to work with you. I hava an AEC in lasalle college programer-analyst program and I am a very logical guy. Other than that, I pretty much check all cases of the nerd stereotype: I play DnD, I am a gamer, I read a lot, I like animes and now I am a programer...
